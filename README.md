# Learning the topology of a Bayesian Network from a database of cases using the K2 algorithm
Final project for the course *Advanced Statistics* at the University of Padova, A.Y. 2023/2024. 

The K2 algorithm ([Cooper/Herskovits](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00994110)) is a heuristic search-method to find the most probable Bayesian belief-network structure, given a database of records. In this project, we implement the K2 algorithm in R with randomly sampled node orderings, and test it on 3 small test datasets (RUIZ, ASIA, CHILD dataset). Additionally, we use the K2 algorithm to construct a Bayesian network from the [UCI Heart disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).
